    "The algorithm used to find the centre coordinates and the radius of the iris and pupil is Daugman. The operator searches for the circular path where there is maximum change in pixel values, varying the raiuds and the centre of the contour. Ths is applied iteratively, only for the centre 1/3 of the image as we assume the pupil is in the centre of the image.\n",

    "## Further Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "This is still a relatively basic implementation of the Daugman algorithm. In pictures of eyes, there can sometimes be [a light reflection that is circular in nature](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/eye-xxl-gm108220711-7593226). This light spots increase the intensity of the image and results in noisiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter this, we can use an operator to fill in the light-affected regions with the average intensities of pixels from the region surrounding it. The image can be modified using MATLAB imfill before being processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the iris border is expected to lie completely inside the image. For every point that we iterate through, the sum of values inside the radius ring is noted. Hence, those which has rings that lie outside of the image dimension can be neglected. \n"
